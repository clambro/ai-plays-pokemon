* Add strength boulders to map screen
* Add sprite and warp long term memory to map view

* Debug logger for prompts with log level set in main
* Some kind of info about items and PC pokemon
* Add a strength puzzle solver?
* Add a tool for spinning around to find wild pokemon
* Might have to drop Pikachu from the map view. I could see that maybe causing problems.
